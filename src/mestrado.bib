  abstract = {A numerical model is used to investigate coastal upwelling in the South Brazil Bight. The wind in the area is pre-dominantly from the northeast, especially in summer, which is upwelling favorahle. Reversals of the wind direction are frequent and intense during the winter, due to the passage of frontal systems. The ofFshore circulation is dominated by the Brazil Current, which flows southward meandering around the 200 m isobath. Significant shelf-break upwelling has being associated with Brazil Current cyclonic meanders. To assess the relative importance of the two processes in the pumping of South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) onto the continental shelf, three cases are analyzed: ID wind-driven upwelling; (2) upwelling induced by Brazil Current meanders and (3) both efFects acting together. The results show that in the coastal area upwelling/downwelling is mainly caused by the wind, whereas the cyclonic meanders of the Brazil Current are the dominant mechanism in the generation of vertical velocities over the shelf break and slope. This meander-induced upward motion brings the SACW to shallower depths, where it is influenced by the wind. In this situation, when both efFects act together, the SACW penetrates all the way to the coast.

@article{Mano2009,
  abstract = {To evaluate the energy flux from the mean flow of South Atlantic western boundary currents toward typical Cabo Frio eddies (at Brazilian southeast coast), the southwestern Atlantic circulation was simulated with the Princeton Ocean Model. Throughout the study period, the vertical profile of eddy available potential energy direction was monitored. The results indicated that baroclinic instability eddies first appear in intermediate depths and then its signal propagates upward, draining energy from the Brazil Current (BC), until it reaches the surface, 30 days after its formation. The depth of eddy formation is related to the vertical profile of the mean potential vorticity crosscurrent gradient (partial derivative(q) over bar/partial derivative s). The beginning of the potential energy flux toward the perturbation and the origin of the eddy occurred at a similar depth and time. The observed pattern suggests the following cycle: 1) a well-defined southwestward-flowing BC in the beginning of the period, with a baroclinically unstable profile of partial derivative(q) over bar/partial derivative s; 2) energy flux from the mean flow toward perturbation at intermediate depth; 3) current destabilization and meandering; 4) formation and growth of the cyclonic eddy; 5) potential energy flux progressively shallower; 6) propagation of the eddy signal upward; and 7) stabilization of the water column.},

@article{Rodrigues2001,
  abstract = {A two-layer finite element model is used to investigate the effects of bottom topography and coastline geometry on the coastal upwelling of the Southeast Brazilian continental shelf. Three cases are analyzed: (1) real topography and real coastline; (2) flat bottom and real coastline and (3) real topography and smoothed coastline. For all the numerical simulations the model was integrated for five days using a constant northeast wind. The first case reproduces reasonably well the characteristics of wind-driven upwelling with respect to location and magnitude. When comparing the second and third case results with the first one, it can be seen that local bottom topography and coastline geometry affect the upwelling magnitude in the whole domain. The coastline irregularities are important in the location of the upwelling cores in the south portion, which extends from Cabo de S{\~{a}}o Tom{\'{e}} to Rio de Janeiro, primarily near Cabo Frio. Moreover bottom topography seems to be responsible for the location of the upwelling cell in the north portion of the domain, from Cabo de S{\~{a}}o Tom{\'{e}} to Vit{\'{o}}ria. In contrast to previous findings, the coastline irregularities are found to dominate over topographic variations in determining the location of Cabo Frio coastal upwelling. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract = "During July 1973 a hydrographic survey was conducted off the southern coast of Brazil in order to investigate features of the Brazil Current near Cape Frio (Fig. 1). A meander pattern and the presence of an anticyclonic eddy separating the stream into two branches were both detected by geostrophic computations. The geostrophic velocities for the shoreward branch ranged from 55 to 75 cm s−1 at the surface, whereas the other branch attained velocities on the order of 20 cm s−1. The volume transport across both branches, from the surface to 600 m, was computed to be 9.4 × 106m3s−1. A correlation between upwelling normally observed on the shelf coastal region and the dynamics of the Brazil Current is also suggested."

  abstract = "In the present work, nine years of altimetry data are analyzed in combination with sea surface temperature and ocean color images in order to track Brazil Current eddies generated at Cape São Tomé, Brazil. Direct evidences are presented that at least six eddies detach from the main current during this period giving rise to isolated rings. Two rings move southward, bordering the current, while four migrate northward, and translate in the direction of the Tubarão Bight. These rings eventually reach the bight, leading to a cyclonic circulation in that region that is analogous, at surface levels, to what would be observed during formation of the Vitória Eddy. For one ring, the observations are complemented by in situ measurements: a Lagrangian surface drifter, an expandable bathythermograph section during the ring formation at Cape São Tomé, and acoustic Doppler current profiler data during the ring formation and inside the bight. The cyclonic circulation within the bight in this occasion reaches levels much deeper than those previously reported for locally-generated eddies. These results indicate that properties of shelf and slope waters near Cape São Tomé can be carried upstream the Brazil Current, eventually influencing the coastal waters further north, with possible ecological and environmental implications."
